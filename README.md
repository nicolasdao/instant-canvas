# InstantCanvas

Death to the admin panel: a local, schema-driven canvas runtime that lets coding agents render data visually (charts, tables, KPIs, markdown) and safely collect user input — forms, secrets, confirmations — in the user's browser, with values written straight to local files and **never entering the chat**.

## What this repository is (and is not)

**This repository is not the skill — it is the workbench that maintains it.** The skill itself is the self-contained package at `.agents/skills/instant-canvas/` (published to the HappySkills registry as `nicolasdao/instant-canvas`): its SKILL.md, runtime scripts, examples, and vendored assets. Everything inside that folder ships in the published bundle and is exposed to the skill's consumers and their agents' context windows.

Everything *outside* it exists to develop and maintain the skill: this documentation (`docs/`), the specifications (`specs/`), the UI prototype (`prototype/`), showcase canvases (`demos/`), and any end-to-end tooling. It lives out here **deliberately** — a skill this large needs real maintainer documentation, but maintainer material inside the skill folder would bloat the published bundle and pollute what the world (and every consuming agent) receives. Keep the boundary strict: consumer-facing content goes in the skill folder, maintainer-facing content goes in the repo.

## Overview

InstantCanvas is a [HappySkills](https://happyskills.dev)-authored skill for coding agents. The paradigm is a strict separation of concerns: **the LLM wrangles data into a JSON contract; the skill owns all rendering.** An agent writes a `*.canvas.json` file, runs `open`, and a persistent per-workspace localhost kernel renders it in the default browser with hot reload. Display canvases return immediately; form and confirm canvases block until the human responds in the browser — and the agent receives redacted metadata only (field names, never values).

Instead of maintaining an answers *warehouse* (pre-built admin panels), agents deliver answers *on the fly* — disposable, data-driven views generated the moment a question is asked. See [docs/mission.md](docs/mission.md) for the full framing.

Two design commitments run through everything:

- **Progressive disclosure.** The skill is large (26 chart kinds, 16 field types, a full form-layout system), but agents never load it wholesale: `catalog` returns a ~6 KB lean index; `catalog <name>` returns exactly one schema; the deterministic validator turns mistakes into self-explanatory fixes.
- **Zero dependencies.** Plain Node ≥ 20, built-in `http`, a hand-rolled WebSocket server, four vendored browser files (a custom strict Plotly.js build, its stylesheet, markdown-it, and a full highlight.js). Node itself `require`s none of them. No build step, no npm install — rebuilding the Plotly and highlight.js bundles is a maintainer-only task, documented in `scripts/web/vendor/VENDORED.md`.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 20, a desktop browser. All commands run from the skill root:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/instant-canvas

# explore the contract (lean index → one schema at a time)
node scripts/instantcanvas.js catalog
node scripts/instantcanvas.js catalog sankey

# render a canvas (spawns/reuses the workspace kernel, opens the browser)
node scripts/instantcanvas.js open examples/report.canvas.json

# the agentic loop
node scripts/instantcanvas.js stamp my.canvas.json      # the skill writes "createdWith", never the agent
node scripts/instantcanvas.js validate my.canvas.json   # exit 1 → fix from errors[] → repeat
node scripts/instantcanvas.js open my.canvas.json       # one JSON result on stdout

# lifecycle
node scripts/instantcanvas.js status
node scripts/instantcanvas.js stop

# tests (176, zero deps; the browser tests skip without Chrome)
node --test scripts/test/
```

`examples/` contains four ready canvases (visual report, secrets → `.env` form, danger confirm, mixed); `demos/` at the repo root holds larger showcases (all 17 general chart kinds, the 9 scientific ones, slider-driven sweeps, the form kitchen sink).

## Documentation

Start with the mission — it is the decision-making compass for this project, at two levels. **Proactive**: when a bug fix or feature request comes in, the mission is the lens for interpreting it, steering implementations toward the project's actual goals. **Reactive**: when multiple valid approaches exist, the mission usually decides without asking the user — escalate only on genuine conflicts it cannot resolve.
