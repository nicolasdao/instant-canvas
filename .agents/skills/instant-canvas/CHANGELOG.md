# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08

InstantCanvas MVP — local, schema-driven interaction runtime for coding agents.

### Added
- **Canvas contract**: envelope (`"instantcanvas": 1`, `blocks` XOR `pages`), 6 block types (`markdown`, `kpi`, `chart`, `table`, `form`, `confirm`), **17 chart kinds** (line, area, bar, pie+donut, scatter, heatmap, radar, funnel, gauge, candlestick, boxplot, sankey, graph, treemap, sunburst, parallel, themeRiver — each with its own encoding schema, when-to-use guidance and validated example; asset/function-dependent ECharts kinds documented as unsupported), 16 form field types; declarative schema registry as single source of truth for the validator and `catalog`.
- **Progressive-disclosure catalog**: bare `catalog` prints a ~4 KB lean index (one-liners only); `catalog <name>` returns ONE full schema (block, chart kind, field type, `fieldset`, `envelope`); `catalog --full` dumps everything.
- **Validator**: collects all errors in one pass with humanized messages, `Did you mean` hints (alias + Levenshtein), examples, and warnings for unknown properties.
- **CLI** (`open` / `validate` / `catalog` / `status` / `stop`): stdout is exactly one JSON document, logs on stderr through the redaction layer; display canvases return immediately, form/confirm canvases block until the human responds in the browser.
- **Per-workspace kernel**: 127.0.0.1-only, per-kernel token (timing-safe compare), Host-header check, CSP, hand-rolled RFC 6455 WebSocket hot reload, idle auto-shutdown, health-ping registry with stale-entry recovery.
- **Secure forms**: values written directly to `.env` (parse-preserving merge) or JSON files; overwrite and outside-workspace writes require in-browser confirmation; server-side re-validation; secrets are registered with the redaction layer before any processing and appear in no result, log, or error.
- **Frontend**: prototype-faithful shell (light/dark), markdown-it and ECharts 5.6.0 vendored (served, never required), hot-reload client, folder browser to open other workspaces on their own kernels.
- **Tests**: 79 node:test tests (zero dependencies) covering the library, validator, kernel, CLI, form flows, and security regressions (403s, traversal, redaction sweep, loopback-only bind).
- **Form system**: fieldset grouping with 1–3-column grids (`{"type":"fieldset","legend","columns","fields"}` inside `fields[]`, per-field `span`), presentation variants (`ui: "buttons"` segmented select/radio, `ui: "pills"` searchable multi-select), bespoke widgets throughout — select menu, date and datetime calendar popover (month/year quick-nav, time section), custom radios/checkboxes/slider — all Lucide-iconed, CSP-strict (no inline styles), with values/serialization identical to the base types.

### Known limitations
- Windows: implemented per spec (paths, detached spawn, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`), not yet verified on a Windows machine.
- The bundled ECharts UMD (1.03 MB) exceeds the HappySkills 1 MB bundle validator cap; only relevant if the skill is published.
